    <h1>What is XML?</h1>
  
    <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong>markup language</strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
        <li>XML tags not predefined. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
        <li>XML use a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong>(DTD) or an <strong>XML Schema</strong> to describe the data</li>
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML S Chema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>The main difference between XML and HTML</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>XML was designed to carry data.</strong></p><br>
    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.</p>
    <p>XML and HTML were designed with different goals.</p><br>
    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is</p>
    <p>HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p><br>
    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>

    <h2><strong>XML does not DO anything</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>XML was not designed to DO anything.</strong></p>
    <P>Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created to structure, store and to send information.</P><br>
    <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:</p><br>

    &lt;note&gt;<br>
    &lt;to&gt;Tove&lt;/to&gt;<br>
    &lt;from&gt;Jani&lt;/from&gt;<br>
    &lt;heading&gt;Reminder&lt;/heading&gt;<br>
    &lt;body&gt;Don't forget me this weekend !&lt;/body&gt;<br>
    &lt;/note&gt;
    
    <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information.
        But still, this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped
        in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.
